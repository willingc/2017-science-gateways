**Jupyter as a Gateway for Scientific Collaboration and Education**

Presented by Carol Willing, Cal Poly SLO and Jupyter Steering Council [@willingcarol](https://twitter.com/WillingCarol)

## Abstract

**Project Jupyter**, evolved from the IPython environment, provides a platform for
interactive computing that is widely used today in research, education,
journalism and industry. The core premise of the Jupyter architecture is to
design tools around the experience of interactive computing. The **Jupyter
Notebook**, a system that allows users to compose rich documents that combine
narrative text and mathematics together with live code and the output of
computations in any format compatible with a web browser, provides a foundation
for scientific collaboration. The next generation of the Jupyter web interface,
**JupyterLab**, will combine in a single user interface not only the notebook, but
multiple other tools to access Jupyter services and remote computational
resources and data. **JupyterHub** enables Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab to be
used by groups of users for research collaboration and education.
